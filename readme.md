## Snoopy

Snoopy allows you to stream ACT logs to someone who might be interested in receiving it.

ACT plugin: The person streaming should use this 
Desktop client: The person receiving should use this

Both can run in either client or server, so you can set up whichever is easier to work around NATs for and stuff!
